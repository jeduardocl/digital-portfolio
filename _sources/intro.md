```{tab-item} Things I learned
- The structure of a Jupyter Book and how to configure it.
- Using GitHub (this is an exciting step for me!)
- Installing the programs viewed in module one and the use of Conda.
```

```{tab-item} Things I found dificult
- Trying to hide the outputs for a clearer look, I've used this in a personal project but it seems I am unable to do it here with the two apporaches (clicking the "hide-input" or hardcoding the cell metadata). 
- The crossreferencing of an image, I saw the class recordings and copied the code from my collegues but it seems it doesn't work in my workbook. 
- The actual _built operation was a bit confusing at first, but now I see the huge value of this opeartor.
